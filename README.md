## Fun ReAct Lab — Activity Presentation

This repository contains the slide deck and supporting materials for the Fun ReAct Lab, an interactive classroom activity designed to help students learn how AI agents reason using the ReAct pattern:

Thought → Action → Observation → (repeat) → Final Answer

Students work in small teams to complete creative scenarios—Escape Rooms, Food Trucks, Pet Matching, Wizard Quests, and more—by identifying tools, reasoning steps, and failure modes.
No coding required.
